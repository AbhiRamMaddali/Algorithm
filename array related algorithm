This is used is know about the basic idea of the each and every algorithm in the data structures
BASIC SERCHING ALGORITHMS
1.Linear search
*Basic idea:Check each element one by one until you find the target or reach the end.
*Data structures used : array,array list,list,tuple,set ,dictionary.
*mostly used for unsorted array and less used for sorted array
*Meaning of linear :Describes the algorithm's method of examining data sequentially, one element after the other, in a straight line.

2.Binary Search
*Basic idea :
*Data structures used : array,array list,list,tuple.
*only used for sorted array
*Meaning of Binary:refers to the algorithm's core process of making a two-way decision at each step, effectively halving the search space.

BASIC SORTING  ALGORITHM
1.Bubble Sort
*Basic idea:The basic idea of Bubble Sort is to repeatedly step through the list, compare adjacent elements, and swap them if they are in the wrong order. 
Larger (or smaller, depending on the desired sort order) elements "bubble up" to their correct position at the end of the list with each pass
*Data structures used : array,array list,list.
*meaning of Bubble:

2.QUICK SORT
*Basic idea: divide and conquer
Divide the list around a central value (pivot) so that smaller values are on one side and larger on the other, and keep doing this to organize everything into order.
*Data structures used : array,array list,list.
Meaning of quick:

3.MERGE SORT
*basic idea :Break the list into smaller parts until each part has one element, then merge them back together in sorted order to form the final sorted list.
*Data structures used : array,array list,list.

4.INSERTION SORT
Basic idea:
Build the sorted list one item at a time by taking each new element and placing it in its correct position among the already sorted ones—like sorting playing cards in your hand.
It’s like organizing things by picking one item at a time and putting it where it belongs among the things you've already sorted.
*Data structures used : array,array list,list.
Meaning of Insertion:Placing each new element into its correct position within the already sorted part of the list—just like inserting a card into the right spot in your hand while playing cards.

5.SELECTION SORT
Basic idea:Go through the list, pick the smallest item, and put it in the correct position**, then repeat for the rest—like **selecting the smallest thing left and arranging it step by step.
*Data structures used : array,array list,list.
meaning of selection :Choosing (selecting) the smallest or largest element from the unsorted part of the list and moving it to its correct position in the sorted part.
