# üå≥ AVL Tree (Adelson-Velsky and Landis Tree)

## üìò Definition
An **AVL Tree** is a self-balancing **Binary Search Tree (BST)** where the difference of heights between the left and right subtrees (called **Balance Factor**) of any node is at most **1**.

## üîç Why AVL Tree?
In a regular BST, insertion or deletion can cause the tree to become skewed, leading to **O(n)** time complexity for operations.

An AVL Tree maintains balance ‚áí ensures **O(log n)** time for insertion, deletion, and search.

## üß† Properties
- **Balance Factor (BF)** = Height of left subtree ‚àí Height of right subtree
- BF of any node must be **-1, 0, or +1**
- Height of AVL tree with n nodes is **O(log n)**

## üîÅ Rotations to Maintain Balance
When balance is disturbed after insertion or deletion, we perform rotations:

| Case               | Condition                      | Rotation       |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|
| Left-Left (LL)     | Insertion in left of left child | Right Rotate   |
| Right-Right (RR)   | Insertion in right of right child| Left Rotate    |
| Left-Right (LR)    | Insertion in right of left child | Left-Right    |
| Right-Left (RL)    | Insertion in left of right child | Right-Left    |

### ‚ûñ Deletion Cases:
Similar to insertion, after deletion we check and fix balance using rotations.
# üå≥ AVL Tree Deletion ‚Äì Complete Explanation

An **AVL Tree** is a self-balancing binary search tree where the **balance factor** (difference in height between left and right subtrees) of **every node** is **-1, 0, or +1**.

When we **delete a node** from an AVL Tree, we must ensure that the tree remains balanced.

## ‚úÖ Deletion Steps in AVL Tree

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Perform BST Deletion

Follow standard **Binary Search Tree (BST)** deletion logic:

- **No child** (leaf): Remove the node.
- **One child**: Replace the node with its child.
- **Two children**:
  - Find the **inorder successor** (smallest in right subtree).
  - Replace current node‚Äôs value with successor's value.
  - Recursively delete the successor.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Update Height

After deleting a node and returning back up the recursion stack, update the height of the current node:

```python
node.height = 1 + max(height(node.left), height(node.right))
```

## üîß Rotations Visual Example

**Right Rotation (LL):**
```
      z                              y
     / \                           /   \
    y   T4   =>    Right(z) =>    x     z
   / \                                 / \
  x   T3                             T3   T4
```
**Left Rotation (RR):**
```
    z                                 y
   / \                              /   \
  T1  y       =>     Left(z) =>    z     x
      / \                         / \
     T2  x                      T1   T2
```
---
**Right-Left (RL)‚Äì use Right Rotation + Left Rotation**
```
    z                                z                               x
   / \                             /   \                           /   \
  y   T4   ‚Üí  Left(y) ‚Üí          x    T4   ‚Üí  Right(z) ‚Üí         y      z
 / \                             / \                            / \    / \
T1  x                          y  T3                          T1 T2   T3 T4
    / \                       / \
  T2  T3                   T1  T2
```
**Left-Right (LR)‚Äì use Left Rotation + use Right Rotation**
```
      z                                z                               x
     / \                             /   \                           /   \
   T1   y      ‚Üí   Right(y) ‚Üí      T1    x     ‚Üí   Left(z) ‚Üí         z      y
       / \                           / \                            / \    / \
      x  T4                        T2  y                           T1 T2  T3 T4
     / \                               / \
   T2  T3                            T3  T4
```

**üìà Example:**
Insert 10 ‚Üí 20 ‚Üí 30 into an empty tree.

After inserting 30, the tree becomes unbalanced (Right-Right case).

Perform Left Rotation on node 10.

The tree becomes balanced again.
```
Before Rotation:         After Left Rotation:
     10                         20
       \                      /   \
       20       ‚Üí           10    30
         \
         30
```

## üõ†Ô∏è AVL Tree Operations

1. **Insertion**  
   - Same as BST insertion.  
   - Update height.  
   - Check balance factor.  
   - Perform rotation if needed.

2. **Deletion**  
   - Same as BST deletion.  
   - Replace node if it has two children.  
   - Update height.  
   - Check and fix balance.

3. **Search**  
   - Same as BST, with **O(log n)** complexity.

**WHY AVL TREE**

# AVL Tree Explained Simply

## Imagine a Tree That Doesn‚Äôt Get "Lopsided"

A normal "family tree" (binary search tree) can get messy and tall on one side if you add or remove people randomly. This makes searching slow.

An **AVL tree** is a smart tree that **automatically fixes itself to stay balanced** ‚Äî meaning no side gets too long or heavy.

---

## How Does It Stay Balanced?

Every person (node) in the tree checks their **Balance Factor** ‚Äî the difference in height between their left and right sides.

**Example:**  
If Alice has 3 people on her left and only 1 on her right, that‚Äôs an imbalance. The left side is too heavy!

---

## Fix It with Rotations

If the tree becomes lopsided, it does simple rotations, like rearranging a shelf of books to spread them evenly:

- **Left-heavy?** Rotate right.  
- **Right-heavy?** Rotate left.  
- If it‚Äôs zig-zag shaped (left-right or right-left), do two rotations.

(Imagine grabbing a node and ‚Äútwisting‚Äù the tree to spread it out evenly!)

---

## Why Care?

Because the tree is always balanced, operations like searching, inserting, and deleting are **fast and efficient** ‚Äî guaranteed to work in **O(log n)** time.  
Unlike a messy normal tree that can become slow like a linked list, AVL trees stay quick.

---

## Real-Life Analogy

Think of an AVL tree like a **self-adjusting seesaw**. If one side gets heavier, it automatically shifts weights (rotations) to stay level.

---
## TL;DR:"Too Long; Didn't Read.

AVL trees are binary search trees that fix their own balance to stay short and efficient, using simple ‚Äútwists‚Äù (rotations) whenever things get lopsided.
